# fastai4GLAMS study group 
A study group for v4 of the fastai introduction to deep learning course with a focus on applications in GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives, and museums) 

## tl;dr 
a study group:
- following v4 of the [fastai](https://www.fast.ai/) [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) course with a focus on applications in GLAM settings 
- focused on helping each other out 
- tackling domain specific issues 
- has a practical focus 

## Practical Deep Learning for Coders, v4
This course will follow v4 of the [fastai](https://www.fast.ai/) [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/)

### What the course covers:
- 🤔 Ethics 
- 👀 CV (Computer vision)
- 📖 NLP (Natural Language Processing) 
- 🗂 Tabular Data 
- 🤖 Deployment of models 
- 🐍 I have picked up ++ Python from doing previous versions of this course

### Why you might want to do the course?

There is a lot of interest in applying AI/ machine-learning in GLAM settings with people a range of potential applications being explored. There is also sometimes the perception that machine-learning is very hard or can only be done by large tech companies. The fastai course aims to make deep-learning (a branch of machine learning) acccesible while not hiding the important underlying theory. As a result I think this course is could be very useful for people working in/with GLAM instutions as it will:

- Allow you to start using deep-learning in a hands-on way and you may be able to solve problems at work using machine learning
- Doing things yourself will giv you a much better sense of what is possible and how things work 
- if you collobarate with computer scientitis, commerical companies etc. on ai projects you will: 
    - a) be better able to communicate with them
    - b) have a better sense of whether a vendor or commerical partner is overpromissing 
    - c) be more aware of things about the GLAM setting that can pose challenges for macine-learning approaches
- 😃 it's fun
