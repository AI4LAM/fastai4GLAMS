# fastai4GLAMS study group 
A study group for v4 of the fastai introduction to deep learning course with a focus on applications in GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives, and museums) 

## tl;dr 
a study group:
- following v4 of the [fastai](https://www.fast.ai/) [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) course with a focus on applications in GLAM settings 
- focused on helping each other out 
- tackling domain specific issues 
- has a practical focus 

## Practical Deep Learning for Coders, v4
This course will follow v4 of the [fastai](https://www.fast.ai/) [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/)

### What the course covers:
- ü§î Ethics 
- üëÄ CV (Computer vision)
- üìñ NLP (Natural Language Processing) 
- üóÇ Tabular Data 
- ü§ñ Deployment of models 
- üêç I have picked up ++ Python from doing previous versions of this course

### Why you might want to do the course?

There is a lot of interest in applying AI/ machine learning in GLAM settings with a range of potential applications being explored. There is also sometimes the perception that machine learning is very hard or can only be done by large tech companies. The fastai course aims to make deep learning (a branch of machine learning) acccesible while not hiding the important underlying theory. As a result I think this course is could be very useful for people working in/with GLAM instutions because:

- It will allow you to start using deep learning in a hands-on way, and you may be able to solve problems at work using machine learning
- Doing things yourself will give you a much better sense of what is possible and how things work 
- If you collaborate with computer scientists, commercial companies etc. on ai projects, the course should help you to: 
    - a) be better able to communicate with them
    - b) have a better sense of whether a vendor or commerical partner is overpromising 
    - c) be more aware of things about the GLAM setting that can pose challenges for machine-learning approaches
- üòÉ It's fun! 

## How the study group will work 
This study group will be primarily asynchronous with discussions taking place on the fastai [forums](forums.fast.ai/). The reason this has been chosen over a slack group is that:
- there is already a ton of expertise on the fastai forums 
- a slack channel is semi-private which means it's a bigger barrier to join and discussions get lost 
- the forum discussions can be a resource that people might stumble upon through a google search in the future 

If there is interest we can set up a video call(s) at some point during the course to discuss how we're getting on.
